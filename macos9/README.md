# NetSurf Mac OS 9 Port (Stub)

This directory contains an experimental stub of a NetSurf port to classic
Mac OS 9. The implementation is highly simplified and intended only as a
placeholder demonstrating how such a port might be structured.

To build the stub you will need the Retro68 toolchain and the NetSurf
libraries compiled for m68k-apple-macos.

```bash
./build.sh
```
